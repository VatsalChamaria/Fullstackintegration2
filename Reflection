From the first line of code to performance tuning, Copilot was like a trusted co-developer sitting beside me, anticipating challenges and offering clear, contextual solutions.
It all started with getting the API integration right — Copilot helped me update the front-end calls in FetchProducts.razor to align with the correct route (/api/productlist) on the back end. It even tackled tricky CORS issues by guiding me to insert the precise middleware into the Program.cs file, saving hours of debugging across browsers.
As I structured the API responses, Copilot walked me through building nested JSON with categories, then nudged me toward creating strongly typed models for better maintainability. It explained how using Product and Category classes would streamline both serialization and front-end binding.
When I hit performance snags, Copilot recommended in-memory caching on the server with IMemoryCache, and on the client side, it helped me refactor repeated API calls into a shared Blazor service. That not only made the app faster, but also more elegant behind the scenes.
And it didn’t stop there — it showed me how to:
- Catch and handle malformed JSON gracefully
- Reduce redundant HTTP requests in the Blazor app
- Build and test a fully functional ProductController with CRUD endpoints
- Create the ProductList.razor component to fetch and render the product data with clean fallback UI for loading and error states
What made it incredible was that Copilot didn’t just dump code — it explained why things worked, flagged better practices, and gave me alternatives. It felt less like I was following instructions and more like I was learning while building.
In the end, I didn’t just create a functional app — I walked away with a deeper understanding of clean architecture, performance tuning, and API integration, all thanks to the collaborative support of Copilot.
